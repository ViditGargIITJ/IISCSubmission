Submission for summer research Intern
I have submitted only question 2 (including the bonus part)
NOTE: I know that I am not eligible for this Winter Internship, but I am very much interested in graph theory and its applications. I would like to work in the summer of 2024 as a research Intern (Will be available onsite). 
I am just giving my short Introduction.
I am a prefinal year student from IIT Jodhpur pursuing a B. Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, my CGPA up to the 4th semester is 8.05.
My excellent problem-solving skills earned me an A grade in Data Structures and Algorithms, and Intro to Electrical Engineering and an A- in Introduction to Probability Statistics and Stochastic Processes, Maths for Computing and Signals and Systems, these courses demanded strong mathematical skills, which I successfully applied. My rank in JEE-ADVANCE 2021 was 3284.
Thank you for giving time to my Solution, and Sorry if I wasted your time.
